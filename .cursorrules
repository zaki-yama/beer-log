## Development Workflow

1. **Task Management**:
   - Check `docs/todo.md` at the beginning of each development session
   - Review and update task status in `docs/todo.md` as needed
   - Prioritize tasks based on the order in `docs/todo.md`

2. **Code Changes and Commits**:
   - Make code changes in small, logical units
   - Do not commit changes without explicit approval from the user
   - When changes are ready, notify the user and wait for their approval to commit
   - Follow the commit message rules above when committing

3. **Work Log**:
   - At the end of each development session, conduct a retrospective
   - Create a work log file with the current date (e.g. `2025-02-23.md`) in the `docs/work-logs` directory
   - The work log should include:
     1. **作業内容**: Brief description of the work done today
     2. **所感**: First, discuss impressions and feedback in a dialogue format, then summarize the discussion
     3. **次回の作業予定**: Brief description of planned work for the next session
   - Commit the work log with the message format: `docs: add work log for YYYY-MM-DD`
