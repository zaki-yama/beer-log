   - Review and update task status in `docs/todo.md` as needed
   - Prioritize tasks based on the order in `docs/todo.md`

2. **Code Changes and Commits**:
   - Make code changes in small, logical units
   - Do not commit changes without explicit approval from the user
   - When changes are ready, notify the user and wait for their approval to commit
   - Follow the commit message rules above when committing
