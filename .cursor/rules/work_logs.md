# Work Logs

1. **Creation Timing**:
   - At the end of each development session, conduct a retrospective
   - Create a work log file with the current date (e.g. `2025-02-23.md`) in the `docs/work-logs` directory

2. **Content Structure**:
   The work log should include:
   1. **作業内容**: Brief description of the work done today
   2. **所感**: First, discuss impressions and feedback in a dialogue format, then summarize the discussion
   3. **次回の作業予定**: Brief description of planned work for the next session

3. **Commit Process**:
   - Commit the work log with the message format: `docs: add work log for YYYY-MM-DD`
